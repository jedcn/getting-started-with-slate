# You can normally switch between windows on MacOS by pressing
# COMMAND-TAB. The following Slate configuration provides an
# alternative:
#
# COMMAND + CONTROL + ; will cause Slate to display the letters on the
# home row above window. Logos will appear on these letters, and you
# can press the letter to switch to that window.
#
bind ;:cmd;ctrl hint ASDFGHJKL



#
# These bindings make it so that you can more easily move windows to
# other displays. If you have two displays, you can press CTRL + CMD +
# 2 to cause the current window to be moved, and appear full screen,
# on your second display. If you subsequently press CTRL + CMD + 1,
# the window which was just moved to your second display will come
# back to your first display
